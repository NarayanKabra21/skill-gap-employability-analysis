# Skill Gap and Employability Analysis

This project is my first data science project.
It focuses on understanding how academic performance, technical skills,
and practical exposure affect the employability of engineering students.

The goal of this project is to use exploratory data analysis (EDA)
to identify skill gaps that influence placement outcomes.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
