# Skill Gap and Employability Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a data-driven analysis of factors influencing the employability of engineering students. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project examines how academic performance, technical skills, and communication skills collectively impact placement outcomes.

The objective is to identify key skill gaps and provide insights into which attributes contribute most significantly to employability beyond academic scores alone.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Academic performance is often considered the primary determinant of student placements. However, employers increasingly evaluate candidates based on a combination of technical proficiency, soft skills, and practical exposure.

This project aims to analyze:
- The relationship between academic performance (CGPA) and placement outcomes
- The impact of coding skills on employability
- The role of communication skills in securing placements

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Academic performance alone does not guarantee placement**  
   While CGPA plays a role in employability, there is significant overlap between placed and non-placed students, indicating that academics alone are not sufficient.

2. **Coding skills significantly improve employability**  
   Students with higher coding proficiency demonstrate better placement outcomes, even when academic scores are moderate, highlighting the importance of technical skills.

3. **Communication skills enhance placement outcomes**  
   Strong communication skills positively influence employability, emphasizing the value of soft skills alongside technical knowledge.

---

## 🎯 Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates that employability is influenced by a combination of academic performance, technical skills, and communication skills. Candidates with balanced skill sets are better positioned to secure placements compared to those relying solely on academic achievements.

These findings highlight the importance of holistic skill development for improving employment outcomes.
