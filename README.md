    # Skill Gap and Employability Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is my first data science project. It focuses on understanding how academic
performance, technical skills, and soft skills influence the employability of engineering
students.

The project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify skill gaps that impact
placement outcomes and highlights the importance of skill development beyond academics.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many students believe that a high CGPA alone guarantees placement. However, employability
depends on multiple factors such as coding skills, communication skills, and practical
exposure.

This project aims to analyze:
- Whether CGPA alone determines placement
- The impact of coding skills on employability
- The role of communication skills in placement outcomes
