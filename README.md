    # Skill Gap and Employability Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is my first data science project. It focuses on understanding how academic
performance, technical skills, and soft skills influence the employability of engineering
students.

The project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify skill gaps that impact
placement outcomes and highlights the importance of skill development beyond academics.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many students believe that a high CGPA alone guarantees placement. However, employability
depends on multiple factors such as coding skills, communication skills, and practical
exposure.

This project aims to analyze:
- Whether CGPA alone determines placement
- The impact of coding skills on employability
- The role of communication skills in placement outcomes

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains student-level information including:
- CGPA
- Codin

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **CGPA alone does not guarantee placement**  
   The analysis shows that students with high CGPA are not always placed. While academic performance is important, it is not sufficient on its own to ensure employability.

2. **Technical (coding) skills significantly improve placement chances**  
   Students with stronger coding skills have a noticeably higher placement rate, even when their CGPA is average. This highlights the importance of practical technical skills in hiring decisions.

3. **Communication skills play a critical role in employability**  
   The results indicate that students with better communication skills are more likely to be placed, especially when combined with technical knowledge. Employers value candidates who can effectively communicate ideas and work in teams.

## 🎯 Conclusion
This project demonstrates that employability is influenced by a combination of academic performance, technical skills, and soft skills. A balanced skill set is more effective for securing placements than relying on academics alone.
